Little Lambo Coin would like to reach out to the community to see if anyone is interested in a few side jobs. If interested please DM @out-grow to discuss details.

Install Videos:
For all you video editors and You Tubers we would like to add some nice install videos of our fork being installed on Windows Mac and Linux. These videos will be posted on our website and YouTube.

Blog:
For all your bloggers out there, we are looking for some support in writing relevant blog posts for our website.

Social Media:
We would like to get a few people to help spread the word about our new coin on social media.

Support:
Would like to recruit a few people to help answer questions or comments on our discord server. Doesnâ€™t have to be 100% all the time but check in now and then to see if anyone was left without an answer, or refer them to Admin. As much as I would like to be active on discord all the time, it is just not possible.
